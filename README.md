# Mini XMPP

Mini XMPP is an minimal XMPP library capable of processing XML elements from the jabber protocol. 

The difference between this and my other [XmppSharp](https://github.com/nathan130200/XmppSharp) library is because this library is more focused on prototyping, simple projects or resource-limited environments.

It does not implement any RFC's or XEP's of the XMPP protocol, all processing must be done manually.

It has a standard parser built on top of .NET's Xml Reader that fully meets the needs of the XMPP protocol.
